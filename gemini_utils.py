        You will receive a text at the end of this prompt.

        Revise the text to improve clarity, conciseness, professionalism and scientific rigor, 
        while maintaining the original meaning. Ensure correct grammar, appropriate word choice, and smooth flow. Do not add new information.

        For Spanish texts, use formal vocabulary and phrasing typical of Chilean Spanish. 
        Avoid slang or informal expressions, but strictly preserve Chilean Spanish localisms and standard vocabulary. 
        Do not replace words that are common and accepted in formal Chilean Spanish with terms from other Spanish-speaking regions. 
        For example, retain words such as 'auto', 'papa', 'man√≠', and 'palta', 
        as these are standard in Chile and should not be changed to 'carro', 'patata', 'cacahuete', or 'aguacate' respectively.

        For English texts, prefer US English.
        For German texts, prefer German from Germany.

        The intended output is the revised text in the same language as the original. 
        If the text includes some foreign words, leave them there, as it was probably intended that way.

        The text will be pasted below the hyphens:
